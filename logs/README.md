I am going to make STRIKE, A High Precision AI Framework for the early prediction of Natual Disasters.

The thing that really drove me to work on this was seeing the fires in by our house in March/April. The LA Fires. The Denver Fires. The bay area fires that may be starting now... I have lived in SF, Denver, and am in Florida. 

This has got to stop. Thousands of Lives are at stake. Bilions of dollars are at stake.
And we aren't prepared for the wrath of is before us.

As of July 2025, I have read increasing accounts in the newspaper detailing natural disasters that are causing mass destruction. All of these have taken lives and caused mass damage.

These include but are not limited to:

- The LA Wildfires
- The Texas 'Summer Camp' Fluvial Flooding
- Torrential Rainfall in South Korea.
